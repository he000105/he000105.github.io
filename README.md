This project used bootstrap framwork along with original css flex box.

The navigation bar used bootstrap toogle to make a responsive dropdown bar for mobile site as well as using offcanves child list, with a clickable logo which linked to the home page. Making this navigation bar, to ensure it has a same style of each nav-link, I changed the button of offcanvas child list to nav-link along with the database and javascripes to get a well funtion nav bar.

On index page, contact page, web page, I used Bootstrap grid system to build the layout along with css specific styling.
