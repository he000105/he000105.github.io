This project used bootstrap framwork along with original css flex box, google fonts, font awesome icons.

The navigation bar used bootstrap toogle to make a responsive dropdown bar for mobile site as well as using offcanves child list, with a clickable logo which linked to the home page. Making this navigation bar, to ensure it has a same style of each nav-link, I changed the button of offcanvas child list to nav-link along with the database and javascripes to get a well funtion nav bar.

On index page, contact page, web page, I used Bootstrap grid system to build the layout along with css specific styling. To make sure getting the best layout, I used css to style the elements for all the pages all together.

For the Photography page, I used flex css flex box to modify the layout.

There is some difficulties building this website. How to specify the tag to change the style with Bootstrap framwork defult style. I stragle a little bit aligning the content especially with Bootstrap. To solve this problem, I added some id in HTML. Also building a responsive multi-pages website required a strong logical site map to plan in advance. Also comments are important in development.

After making this portfolio, I gainted a lot. Understanded how important prototyping is in web development. Web design can be complex and fancy but also needs to consider the developing process. It has to be balance out between design and develop.
