            <p>
                I am <strong>Angel</strong>, former name is <em>Haiyan He</em>, was born on Augest 21<sp>st</sp>, a
                summer girl.
                I got my bachelor back in 2018. Currently in Seattle,
                <abbr tittle="Washington State, United States of America">WA, U.S.A.</abbr>
                and hopefully I am able to get to Ottawa soon.
                <br>Growing up with passion of art and design, I would like to work in this area. I felt like I need to
                boost my career by taking a grad school program so here I am. I learnt some coding back in undergrad
                school and now
                probably forgot most of them without coding for years.
                <br>To become a professional <abbr tittle="User Experience Designer">UX designer</abbr>, I think I need
                to start working on programing, at least pick up some coding.
                My goal in <abbr title="Interactive Media Desigh">IMD</abbr> is to <u>learn latest skills of interactive
                    media</u>,
                get to know people around the world, get to experience relocating to a new place (yah a whole new world
                comparing with Seattle), also hopefully <u>get some working experience from Co-Op</u>.
