                <p>
                    I am <strong>Angel</strong>, former name is <em>Haiyan He</em>. 
                    I got my bachelor back in 2018. Currently in Seattle, <abbr tittle="Washington State, United States of America">WA, U.S.A.</abbr> 
                    and hopefully I am able to get to Ottawa soon. 
                    <br>Growing up with passion of art and design, I would like to work in this area. I felt like I need to boost my career 
                    by taking a grad school program so here I am. I learnt some coding back in undergrad school and now probably forgot most 
                    of them without coding for years. 
                    <br>To become a professional <abbr tittle="User Experience Designer">UX designer</abbr>, I think I need to start working on programing, at least pick up some coding. 
                    My goal in <abbr title="Interactive Media Desigh">IMD</abbr> is to <u>learn latest skills of interactive media</u>,
                    get to know people around the world, get to experience relocating to a new place (yah a whole new world comparing with Seattle), also hopefully <u>get some working experience from Co-Op</u>.
