                    I am Angel, former name is Haiyan He. I got my bachelor in 2018. Currently in Seattle and hopefully I am able to get in Ottawa soon. Growing up with passion of art and design, I would like to work  in this area. I feel like I need to boost my career by taking a grad school program so here I am. 
I learnt some coding back in undergrad school and now probably forgot most of them without coding for years. To become a professional User Experience Designer, I think I need to start working on programing, at least pick up some coding. 
My goal in this program is to learn latest skills of interactive media, get to know people around the world, get to experience relocating to a new place( yah a whole new world comparing with Seattle), also hopefully get some working experience from Co-Op.
